# News-Popularity-Prediction-Sentimental-Analysis-
This project is all about the prediction of the sentiment score of the Title and the Headline of the news articles using machine learning model and data analysis.

## Project Summary

The development of world wide web with easy access to massive information sources anywhere and anytime paves way for more people to rely on online news media rather than print media. And this has become especially true with ad revenue falling drastically in the year 2020 due to COVID-19. After it, the scenario expedites rapid growth of online news industries and leads to substantial competitive pressure.For reasons that more and more people read online news and editors want their news to be popular, it would be meaningful to build a system to predict whether a news will be popular or not. So we are trying to create such model for the prediction of popularity of news.

News popularity prediction is the process of using artificial intelligence to predict how popular a news piece will be among readers. This process relies on machine learning techniques to analyze the characteristics of a news piece such as content, style, format, and topics in order to predict its potential engagement. AI-powered tools are increasingly used to accurately predict the popularity of news articles and content, allowing businesses to maximize its reach and increase their earnings from digital media platforms. By leveraging machine learning models, AI-powered news popularity prediction can give publishers insight into which stories are likely to become popular and aid them in making decisions about which stories to prioritize and how to best promote them.

## Problem Statment

In this project, the motive is the find and explore the dataset given and be in a role to realize essential insights that can be used to influence achievable article popularity. Also, Machine Learning Model was built to be in a position to predict the awareness of a given article.

The prediction can be made through statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis techniques (AI) to predict the popularity of news articles. For example, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on historical data to make predictions based on some patterns. This would involve building a model that could take in various parameters such as article content, headline, topics, author, etc. and use these to accurately predict the number of likes or shares a news article will receive. Furthermore, the model should be able to provide insights into why certain articles may be more popular than others.
